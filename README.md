# mgfilehosting
A simple and minimalistic file hosting


# How to setup the file hosting?
First, install Python 3 (3.8 is recommended)
Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then, in the `config.py` file, change the `max_file_size_mb` variable to the maximum size for the uploaded files in megabytes.

And finally, run `python3 website.py` if you are on Linux or macOS, and `python website.py` if you are on Windows.

After you do all of that, your file hosting will be available at port 80.
